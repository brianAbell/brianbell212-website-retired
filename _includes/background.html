      I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech</a> and am aiming to pursue a career in AI Engineering. I recently completed my first internship at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://berkleyalternativemarkets.tech/" target="_blank">Berkley Alternative Markets</a> which allowed me to apply my academic knowledge to real world scenarious. I have also worked as a tutor for 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.chegg.com/" target="_blank">Chegg</a> during my time as an undergraduate student.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
